# Project Story

This project simulates a realistic cloud IAM compromise and follows the full security incident lifecycle.

An IAM credential is misused, triggering automated detection and risk scoring.
High-risk activity results in immediate containment actions.
Post-incident forensics reconstruct attacker behavior and assess impact.
Cross-account trust relationships are analyzed to determine lateral movement risk.
Finally, preventive controls and detection rules are implemented to harden the environment.

The focus of this project is not tools, but **security engineering thinking**:
how cloud incidents are detected, contained, investigated, and prevented in real organizations.
