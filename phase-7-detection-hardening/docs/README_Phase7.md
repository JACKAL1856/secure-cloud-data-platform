# Phase 7 – Detection Hardening & Prevention

## Goal
Reduce likelihood and impact of future IAM compromise.

## Summary
Following the IAM incident (Phases 6A–6C), preventive controls and detection rules were introduced to:
- restrict excessive permissions
- detect anomalies earlier
- alert security teams faster

This phase focuses on **long-term security posture**, not reactive response.
